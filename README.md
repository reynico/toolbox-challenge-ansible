# Toolbox Devops automation exam

### Intro
Toolbox's first interview/screening asks for a couple of questions and to automate a LEMP installation on Centos 7 based on a [Digital Ocean guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-on-centos-7). Thought this will be useful for someone who's learning Ansible. I used Vagrant for testing purposes.

### Requirements
  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  - A Vagrant [provider](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/providers.html) such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

### Run the project
  - vagrant up
  - curl http://localhost:8000
